# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      The Good: 
        https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/airlines.for.america/viz/AverageDomesticAirfareTimeSeries/Dashboard_DomesticTimeSeries 

        - Very precise and simple 
        - Easy to read through
        - Convey the message very well 
        - not much cognitive load on the reader 
        - Sources are mentioned to build trust 
        - color selection supports accessibility 


      The Bad: 
        https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andreask28/viz/NetflixUsageV2/NetflixUsage

        - Color selection is too aggressive, Red everywhere 
            - Usually Red is considered as negative or alert, it is not clear that why those metrics may be dangerous or risk ? 
        - The objective of the visuals is not clear, what is the message to be conveyed ? 
        -  In the first chart, I think simple trend line (line graph) should have conveyed the info better as compared to the cumulative graph through filled trend. 
        - scater plot - their is no legend provided, what does the size of each bubble convey ? This increase cognitive load for better understanding the chart. 
        - 3rd graph (bar plot) is redundant because the same info is conveyed in the first graph to show trend. 


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    The good viz can further be improved as 
    - add axis title and axis marks to help readability 
    - add a slope line to show trend of increase/ decline 
    - legend on the side can improve as well 
    - Chart titles are to be emphasized further hence fonts selection may be revised. 

    The bad viz can be improved by 
    - better color scheme selection 
    - Removing redundant information 
    - Selection of right chart types 
    - Setting up a clear objective before creating charts. 





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
