# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```

        Here are some feedback on accessibility, reproducibility and equitability of the charts presented. 
            - Extensive use of red and black color make it difficult to read for people with color vision deficiencies. The contract of background and foregound is not considered well for the visuals. 
            - Font size looks quite smaller hence impact readability 
            - White over read in some visuals is difficult to read 
            = the filter drop down arrows, gray over black lack contract hence not very well noticeable. Same is for the fonts used for the drop down menu. 
            - No use of legends increases the cognitive load 
            - Visuals can be reproduced by refreshing the tableau dashboard, provided that same data is made available. Calculations are well kept in tableau.

        Overall Conclusion: 
        The visuals in the mentioned dashboard do not follow the best practices for accessible and equitable visualization. Whereas, it supports reproducibility. 


        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Recommendations: 
        - Use of increased contrast between foreground and background colors. 
        - Increase contrast for text and background color 
        - Use Larger fonts 
        - Use legends 
        - Add Labels 
        - Add notes for important points 
        - Reduce cognitive load and clutter by removing reduntant visuals.

        Here are some feedback on accessibility, reproducibility and equitability of the charts presented. 
        - Right color contrast: The chart uses red and orange for line color and white as background color. Those colors are having good contrast and is supportive for color vision deficient audience. 
        - Font size and font style is suitable 
        - Chart clearly marked important points
        - Legends, axis, titles increased readability. 
        - Charts are pretty much reproducible through tableau calculations, provided that the source data is made available. 
        - Visual design is very much inclusive 
        - There is no evident bias in the viz 

        Conclusion: 
        - This visualization is a good example of accessible, reproducible and equitable viz. 

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
